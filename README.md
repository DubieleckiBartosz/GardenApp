## Technologies

- ASP.NET Core 6.0 WebAPI 
- .NET Core 6.0

## Architecture

Each Module has Clean Architecture and consists of the following submodules (assemblies):

- **Application** - This submodule handles the logic for processing requests
- **Domain** - Contains the core business logic and rules. This layer defines entities, value objects, and domain events, encapsulating the essential concepts and operations of the application
- **Infrastructure** - Responsible for communication with external services and for background processing and data access

## Patterns

- CQRS
- Transactional Outbox and Inbox  - this pattern provides "At-Least-Once delivery" and "At-Least-Once processing"
